# Obstacle Race Game
## Introduction
Welcome to the exciting world of Obstacle Race Game - a thrilling game where you get to drive a car on a 5-lane road while avoiding rocks and collecting coins to score points. Every step you take adds 1 to your score, while every coin you collect adds 5 to your score. But beware! Colliding with a rock will cost you a life, and you only have 3 lives in a game.

Car Road includes three different modes to suit your play style. In Fast mode, you'll have to be quick on your feet as you maneuver your car through traffic. Slow mode, on the other hand, lets you take your time and carefully navigate your way through the obstacles. And if you're feeling adventurous, try Sensors mode, which uses your phone's sensors to control your car's movements.

Once you've finished a game, you can check out the Record Table to see the high scores you achieved on your device. The Record Table also displays the location in a google map of every record created, adding an exciting new dimension to the game.
